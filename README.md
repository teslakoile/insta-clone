Background:
During the pandemic, I enrolled in a short online course about basic web development using Django on Udemy. The capstone project of the course was a basic
to-do app that enables the user to have a to-do list and cross out those that have been completed. I decided to use this as the skeleton for this insta-clone 
project for several reasons: (1) I am a beginner at development and I haven't memorized a lot of code for Django, (2) I think that the functionalities of both 
applications are similar in terms of logic. My use of blocks of code from the to-do project is the reason why some folders, files, variables, and function names 
are related to to-dos. I would assume that code is quite difficult to read for someone other than me, but I think it is a decent attempt at the challenge.
